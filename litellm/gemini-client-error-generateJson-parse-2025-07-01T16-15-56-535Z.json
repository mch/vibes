            "text": "Based on the file and directory structure, this is a **template or boilerplate project for developing a new application or library using TypeScript**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each part tells us:\n\n### High-Level Purpose\n\nThe directory name itself, `typescript-template`, is the biggest clue. This isn't a specific, finished application. It's a pre-configured starting point designed to let a developer quickly begin a new TypeScript project without having to set up all the basic tooling from scratch.\n\n### Technology Stack and Tooling\n\n*   **Language**: **TypeScript**. This is confirmed by `tsconfig.json` (the TypeScript compiler configuration file) and the `.ts` file extensions in `src/` and `test/`.\n\n*   **Runtime Environment**: **Node.js**. The presence of `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and the `node_modules` directory are standard for any project managed with `npm` (Node Package Manager).\n\n*   **Code Quality (Linting/Formatting)**: **Biome**. The `biome.json` file indicates this project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) to enforce a consistent code style and catch potential errors. Biome is a modern, fast alternative to tools like ESLint and Prettier.\n\n*   **Testing**: The project is set up for **unit testing**. The `test/` directory with a `sample.test.ts` file is a clear indicator. The specific testing framework (like Jest, Vitest, or Mocha) would be defined as a dependency in `package.json`.\n\n*   **Version Control**: It's a **Git repository**, indicated by the `.git/` directory. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude files that shouldn't be checked into version control (like `node_modules`).\n\n*   **Editor & Development Experience**:\n    *   `.editorconfig`: Helps maintain consistent coding styles (like indentation and line endings) across different code editors.\n    *   `.zed/tasks.json`: This is a configuration file for the [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev/). It likely defines custom commands or \"tasks\" that you can run from within the editor, such as `npm test` or `npm run build`.\n\n### Project Structure\n\n*   `src/`: This is where your main application source code lives. `index.ts` is the conventional entry point for the application.\n*   `test/`: This folder contains all the test files that verify the code in `src/` works as expected.\n*   `package.json`: The heart of the project. It lists metadata (name, version), dependencies, and scripts (like `start`, `build`, `test`).\n*   `package-lock.json`: This file locks the exact versions of the project's dependencies to ensure that everyone who works on the project has the same set of packages, leading to reproducible builds.\n\n### In short:\n\nYou're looking at a clean, modern, and well-structured starting point for a new TypeScript project. The next logical step would be to run `npm install` to install the dependencies and then look at the `\"scripts\"` section in `package.json` to see how to run, test, and build the project."

Based *strictly* on that response, determine who should logically speak next: the 'user' or the 'model' (you).\n**Decision Rules (apply in order):**\n1.  **Model Continues:** If your last response explicitly states an immediate next action *you* intend to take (e.g., \"Next, I will...\", \"Now I'll process...\", \"Moving on to analyze...\", indicates an intended tool call that didn't execute), OR if the response seems clearly incomplete (cut off mid-thought without a natural conclusion), then the **'model'** should speak next.\n2.  **Question to User:** If your last response ends with a direct question specifically addressed *to the user*, then the **'user'** should speak next.\n3.  **Waiting for User:** If your last response completed a thought, statement, or task *and* does not meet the criteria for Rule 1 (Model Continues) or Rule 2 (Question to User), it implies a pause expecting user input or reaction. In this case, the **'user'** should speak next.\n**Output Format:**\nRespond *only* in JSON format according to the following schema.
