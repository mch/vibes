# Duplication Colouring Book Movies

This turns Llewellyn's original powerpoint sparrow decks into a movie.
I manually used Microsoft 365 Powerpoint Viewer to download the slides as a ZIP of jpegs, and inferred the timing from a youtube video, so it's not perfect.

Another option would be to just unzip the pptx file, find the images in ppt/media, and use those as inputs to ffmpeg.
It would be necessary to add the text to the answer images somehow though.
